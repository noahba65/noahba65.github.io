## Preidcting Divvy Bike Share 
This project uses an advanced neural network learning to predict Divvy bike station usage.
#### [Write Up](/divvy_write_up/)
##### - This links a write up of the Divvy project intended as a mock memo for a semi-techical audience that includes urban planners, data scientists, and professionals within the transportation management and city administration sectors.
#### [Divvy Paper](https://github.com/noahba65/stemGNN_divvy/blob/capstone/Assignments/final-paper/final_paper.pdf)
##### - This links to a highly techinical and academic write up of the project. Note that the results reported here differ slightly from the write up since I used different metrics and sligthly different calculations. 

#### [Divvy Code](https://github.com/noahba65/stemGNN_divvy)
##### - This links to the repoistory containing all the code for both the paper and the write up. The code for the paper is on a seperate branch called `capstone` as it was originally written for my Data Science capstone at Truman State.
